The position property specifies the type of positioning method used 
for an element.
There are five different position values:

1)static This is the normal positioning scheme in which elements are 
positioned as they occur in the normal document flow.
 
2)relative Relative positioning moves the box relative to its original 
position in the flow. The distinctive behavior of relative positioning 
is that the space the element would have occupied in the normal flow 
is preserved.

3)fixed The distinguishing characteristic of fixed positioning is that
 the element stays in one position in the window even when the document 
 scrolls. Fixed elements are removed from the document flow and positioned
 relative to the browser window (or other viewport). rather than another
 element in the document.
 
4)absolute : Absolutely positioned elements are removed from the document 
flow entirely and positioned relative to a containing element 
(weâ€™ll talk more about this later). Unlike relatively positioned elements,
 the space they would have occupied is closed up. In fact, they have no 
 influence at all on the layout of surrounding elements.
 
5)sticky : An element with position: sticky; is positioned based on the 
user's scroll position.A sticky element toggles between relative and 
fixed, depending on the scroll position. It is positioned relative 
until a given offset position is met in the viewport - then it "sticks" 
in place (like position:fixed).

<p>An element with position: static; is not positioned in any special way; it is 
always positioned according to the normal flow of the page:</p>
